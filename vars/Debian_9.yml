# vars file for Debian 9

# The Python package names.  We treat Debian 9 as a special case,
# since the CyHy AMIs (and only the CyHy AMIs) are built on it.
# Therefore it needs python2 support.
package_names:
  - python
  - python3
  # This ensures that Ansible can install packages using python2 or
  # python3
  - python-apt
  - python3-apt
